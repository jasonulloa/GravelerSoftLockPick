# GravelerSoftLockPick

Program created as a response to Austin Hourigan's video, "The SCIENCE of Soft Lock Picking Pokemon," which can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/M8C8dHQE2Ro?si=fTZxZyk9gU3k8Y0z

The program simulates one attempt as rolling a d4 231 times and counting the number of 1s as successes. This repeats one billion times, or until the number of successes in a single attempt reaches or exceeds 177, whichever comes first. The program will report the number of rolls, the maximum number of successes, and the time it took to complete the simulation in hours, minutes, and seconds.
